# Linear Search Algorithm Improvement and Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for an improved version of the linear search algorithm as part of a data structure and algorithm class assignment. The goal of this assignment is to enhance students' understanding of algorithm design, pseudo code writing, performance evaluation, and Big O notation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to help students:

- Understand how to write algorithm pseudo code.
- Practice evaluating the performance of algorithms by determining their Big O notation.
- Enhance their understanding of the importance of efficient code writing in programming.

## Files Included

1. `lab_linear_search.pdf`: Instruction file detailing the assignment requirements.
2. `doubleLinearSearch_Report.pdf`: Analysis report file.
3. `doubleLinearSearch.cpp`: Implementation of the improved linear search algorithm.
4. `simulDoubleLinearSearch.cpp`: Program to simulate and analyze the performance of the algorithm.

## Assignment Requirements

The linear search algorithm is tasked with finding the first two occurrences of a search value within a vector and returning their indices. If the search value is not found twice, a sentinel value (-1) is returned.

### Deliverables:

1. Write algorithm steps using pseudo code.
2. Implement the algorithm in `doubleLinearSearch.cpp`.
3. Calculate the Big O of the algorithm.
4. Create a simulation program in `simulDoubleLinearSearch.cpp` to count the number of steps for different input sizes and report the results.
5. Plot a graph comparing the simulation results with the Big O plot.

## Usage

To use the `doubleLinearSearch.cpp` program, compile it and run it with necessary parameters. Ensure the function `linearSearch` returns the correct indices or sentinel value.

To run the simulation program `simulDoubleLinearSearch.cpp`, compile it and execute it with the specified input sizes. Verify that the average number of steps aligns with the expected performance.

## Notes

- The simulation program generates random input values for each iteration.
- Input sizes range from 10K to 100K elements.
- The simulation iterates 1000 times for each input size.
- Random values range between 0 and 15,000.
